PlanetWarsAI is my lab 4 project for AI development class.

Currently the "Smarto" AI takes the most cost effective planet when ever possible.
And all planets distribute their ships between each other

Some improvements that could be made

-Scouting

-not reinforcing planets that haven't got updated scouting information from the enemy
  
  -> While making sure that planets that are closest to a given enemy planet don't lack needed ships

-in relation to the above, just generally making planets prioritize supporting attack of enemy planets that are the most valuable
